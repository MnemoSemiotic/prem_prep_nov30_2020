Generalized Analytic Approach
1. Observe/Synthesize some phenomenon in nature
    - ex. sitting on a park bench and looking at the feet of
          geese, and marking 1 if they have black feet or 0
          if they have orange feet.
    - ex. counting in binary and summing the bits (for a fixed length of bits)

2. Create a means to organize and observe our results
    - ex. **packing values into a dictionary and printing them to terminal

3. Describe or interpret the phenomenon through the lens of our observations
